# ImageMerge
A simple tool to merge single layers to one image. Including preview window, layer reordering and visibility toggling functionality. Excluding any third-party dependencies.

I created this tool because I needed to combine multiple layers to single images. As I needed to decide which layers to combine, I could not use any batch mode and starting up The GIMP every time took way to long. This is the result of a few days of trying to understand GDI+.

## Usage


## Limitations
- Layers must have the same size, otherwise the preview will not work correctly
- The program might crash after using the ´Clear´ button too much
- No auto-updater (only notification), no settings GUI
